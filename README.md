# Shrewdness
Welcome to the GitHub Repository for my App Academy Capstone Solo Project. The goal of this project is to be a Full Stack Group Chat Application. I will be implementing the Electron Framework to create a native MacOS and Windows application. All this using a NODEjs backend, PostgreSQL database, and a React/Redux front end, styled with CSS and SCSS.

### Splash Page

Location of source code:
- frontend/src/assets/views/Splash

Files:
- index.js
- Splash.scss

Features:
- 10 independently animated SVGs
- 2 animated text blocks
- 3 full with divs with gradient backgrounds
- ONLY accessible when the user is logged out

Highlights:
- Using the linear gradient in the 3 divs
  - the blue div has a very subtle gradient that makes it look a lot nicer
  - the second the third divs have reversed gradients that makes them look like one div
- This page has 12 unique animations
