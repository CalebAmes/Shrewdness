# Shrewdness
Welcome to the GitHub Repository for my App Academy Capstone Solo Project. The goal of this project is to be a Full Stack Chat Application like Discord. I will be implementing the Electron Framework to create a native MacOS and Windows application. All this using a NODEjs backend, PostgreSQL database, and a React/Redux front end, styled completely by hand with CSS.
